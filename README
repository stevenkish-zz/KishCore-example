title: Kish Core

Kish Core is a lightweight ActionScript 3 framework designed for modularity and quick implementation.

Features:
- metadata dependency injection
- fully recursive, xml-driven navigation system
- modified MVC pattern: no centralized model, but controller/view pairs throughout
- controller/view pair implementation to help manage initializing, revealing, concealing, disposal and stage orientation tasks for custom views
- convenience classes such as Draw, KText, KURLLoader and KLoader
- OVP-based KVideoPlayer class
- SWF Address integration

To Compile:
- target Flash Player 10
- use the Flex 3 SDK ( Flex 4 SDK doesn't support the font embedding procedures used here )
